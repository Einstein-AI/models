# LLM Model Integration Repository

Welcome to the **LLM Model Integration** repository! This repository enables users to add their own Large Language Models (LLMs) to the system with ease. You can find examples in the `model_request_example.py` and `sample_chat_record.json` files to guide you in integrating your models.

## Overview

This repository is designed to allow easy integration of various LLM models. Users can upload their own models by following the provided templates and examples, which support flexible model configurations and usage scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Einstein-AI/models.git
   cd models
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Review the example files:
   - **`model_request_example.py`**: This Python script demonstrates how to integrate and call your model.
   - **`sample_chat_record.json`**: A sample chat record for testing model input and output.

## Installation

Install the necessary Python packages via pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated before running the command above.

## Usage

### Adding a New Model

Follow these steps to add your own model:

1. **Prepare your model**: Ensure your model is compatible with the structure outlined in `model_request_example.py`.
   
2. **Add your model to the repository**: Place your model in the appropriate directory (e.g., `/models/your_model_name/`).

3. **Modify the configuration**: Update the configuration in the `config.py` file to reflect your model's settings (e.g., paths, parameters, etc.).

4. **Test your model**: Use the sample chat record provided in `sample_chat_record.json` to test how your model handles inputs and outputs.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how to integrate and call your model:

1. Import the necessary components:
   ```python
   from models import YourModel
   ```

2. Define your model instance and input:
   ```python
   model = YourModel(config)
   input_text = "Your input text here"
   ```

3. Make a prediction:
   ```python
   response = model.predict(input_text)
   print(response)
   ```

For a full example, check out the `model_request_example.py` file.
